# Nameplate Ruler Scaling

A module for FoundryVTT which allows you to scale nameplates for tokens, template measurements, map notes' nameplates and the token drag ruler. 

Built upon code from [earlSt1's Custom Nameplates](https://github.com/earlSt1/vtt-custom-nameplates) with further assistance from taking a long look at [mclemente's Dice Tray](https://github.com/mclemente/fvtt-dice-tray) AppV2 settings menu. 

## Instructions

In the module settings you can find the Configuration button.

- Global configurations will apply to all scenes if they do not have a Local configuration
- Scene specific configurations, or Local configurations, will override the global configuration for the current viewed scene ()
- You can toggle auto-scaling of text by zoom level on or off
